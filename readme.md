## Description

Photographia is a theme meant photo bloggers or photographers.

### Front page panels

If you have a static front page, you can display multiple content blocks inside so-called »panels«. 
To do that, go into »Design« › »Customize« › »Theme options« after setting a static front page. 
Important: The panel option in the customizer is only visible if you are previewing the static front page.

After doing so, you can choose from the following options for each of the four front page panels:

* Display a grid of posts which has a post thumbnail. You can also hide the post titles, only show 
posts with the post formats »Gallery« or »Image« and select a category.
* Display the latest posts from your site. You can define the number of posts to show and optionally 
show a short version, where only the header meta is displayed.
* Display the content of a page.
* Display the content of a post.

Additionally, you can hide the content of the page which is set as the static front page.

One more thing: If you choose a header image, it will be displayed full-screen as the background image 
of the header. The header image is only displayed on the front page with active panels.
